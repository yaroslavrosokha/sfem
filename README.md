# Strategy Frequency Estimation Method (SFEM)

Method to estimate proportions of strategies in the data proposed by Dal Bo and Frechette (2011). This repository consists of an [example Jupyter Notebook to run SFEM](https://github.com/yaroslavrosokha/sfem/blob/master/sfem.ipynb) developed for Romero and Rosokha (2018, 2019, 2023) and Rosokha and Wei (2024).
